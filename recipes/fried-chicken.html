    <h2>Introduction and History</h2>
    <p>Fried chicken, which emerged in the USA, is a world-renowned dish involving chicken meat covered in a blend made with flour and seasonings, then cooked in pig lard or vegetable oil. 
        The preparation starts with dividing a whole chicken into portions: the white meat sections include the breast and the wings, while the dark meat parts consist of thighs and legs. The back is usually disposed of, while the breast is often divided into two bits or cut into long strips, the latter version being called chicken fingers. 
        For tenderizing the meat, chicken pieces are sometimes drenched in buttermilk and then coated in a batter made with flour, seasonings, and occasionally milk or eggs. 
        The batter flavoring commonly includes salt, black pepper, and paprika, sometimes accompanied by chili, garlic, or onion powder. Some extra crunchiness is occasionally acquired by applying a layer of breadcrumbs as well. The chicken pieces are traditionally fried in lard; however, vegetable oils, such as canola, peanut, or corn oil, are regularly used as well. 
        There are three techniques one can use for frying chicken – pan-frying, deep-frying, and broasting, which is a method of cooking chicken using a pressure fryer to accelerate the process. Pan-frying, or shallow frying, includes frying the chicken in a solid pan, using a smaller amount of fat. 
        Deep frying, on the other hand, includes submerging the meat entirely in hot fat, using a deep fryer or a similar device. 
        Fried chicken is traditionally served with mashed potato, macaroni and cheese, gravy, corn on the cob, coleslaw, and biscuits, and is sometimes topped with some hot sauce or paprika for extra spiciness. 
        Cooks from different regions and states of the USA have their own special versions of the dish; for example, the ones from Louisiana like to add Cajun flavorings such as garlic and onion powder, paprika, celery salt, and cayenne, while Nashville cooks often coat the cooked chicken in some spicy chile oil or hot sauce breading. 
        Buffalo wings that allegedly originated in upstate New York are coated in hot sauce and butter, whereas hot chicken stands for chicken pieces covered in cayenne pepper paste and lard. Further modifications include popcorn chicken, small boneless chunks which are dipped in batter, and chicken Maryland, bits covered in spices and flour, then served with some cream gravy. </p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The following recipe is adapted from the All recipes website (www.allrecipes.com). If you wish, skin the chicken pieces before coating them. It is very important that the coated pieces rest long enough for the flour to acquire a paste-like consistency. Take the resting time into account when planning. </p>
    <h3>Cooking tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Meat</strong>: 
            Even though many recipes suggest using a whole disjointed chicken, some sources advise using only thighs and drumsticks, since the breasts take a long time to cook through, while the wings don't contain enough meat for the weight of the batter. 
            Also, some experts advise discarding the skin before coating the pieces, claiming it becomes spongy instead of crunchy beneath the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>How To Cut Up/Disjoint A Whole Chicken</strong>:
            First, pat dry the chicken with a paper towel and then place the chicken breast-side up onto a cutting board. 
            With a sharp knife, slice the skin between the leg and the breast. Pull away the leg until the bone pops up and exposes the joint, then cut right through the joint. 
            Look for the fat line on the leg. With a knife, cut through the joint underneath the fat line to separate the thigh from the drumstick. 
            Remove and separate the other chicken leg in the same way. Now, turn the chicken to the side. 
            Take the wing in your hand, and with your thumb, find the ridge that’s on the inside of the wing — that’s the joint. With a knife, cut through the joint, then, if necessary, cut off the wing tip. Cut off the other chicken wing in the same way. Look for the fat line on the sides of the chicken. With scissors, cut along the line and through the ribs on each side. 
            Then, with your hands, break it in half to separate the backbone — you can keep the backbone for making stock. Place the breast skin side down onto a cutting board. With a knife, cut through the breast bone and the meat — press on the knife forcefully if need be — to split it in two.</li>
        <li><strong>Marinade</strong>:
            Chicken marinade often consists of brine, milk, or buttermilk. Some suggest first brining the chicken overnight, then bathing it in buttermilk for several more hours, while others prefer using a brine with lemon and fresh spices, followed by a quick drench in buttermilk right before cooking. 
            The brine salt tenderizes the meat by breaking down its cellular structure and simultaneously enhances the flavor. 
            Compared to milk, buttermilk supplies a sharper flavor and helps the flour stick better to the soaked meat. 
            Yogurt is another possible choice instead of the milk or buttermilk mixture. Rather than long soaking, certain recipes call for only a short drenching of the meat in milk or water to ensure the flour will adhere to the chicken.
        <li><strong>Fat</strong>:
            Besides using lard, you can use some vegetable oil, such as peanut, canola, corn, or sunflower oil. 
            Choose an oil that has a neutral flavor and a high smoke point (preferably 400ºF/200°C or above). 
            Another option is to use some vegetable shortening. Try adding some clarified butter into the frying oil mix, which will give an extra rich, creamy touch to the dish. 
            Clarify the butter by simmering it, then discarding the whey that is formed on the bottom and the foam that gathers on the top, to significantly raise the butter's smoke point.
        </ul>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>8 Servings</strong></li>
            <li>1 (4 lbs/1.8 kg) chicken</li>
            <li>1 cup (240 ml) buttermilk</li>
            <li>2 cups (240g) all-purpose flour for coating</li>
            <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
            <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>2 qt (1.9 L) vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>    
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1/5</strong>
                Cut up the chicken. For instructions on how to do that, check out our "cooking tips" section.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2/5</strong>
                In a big plastic bag, mix the flour with the seasonings. Then, pour the buttermilk into a bowl.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3/5</strong>
                Drench the chicken pieces in buttermilk and place them in the bag, a few at a time. Seal the bag and shake to make the coating stick. 
                After coating the chicken pieces, place them on a baking tray and cover with some baking paper or a kitchen towel. 
                Let them rest until the flour acquires a paste-like consistency.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 4/5</strong>
                Pour vegetable oil into a big cast iron pan (1/3 to ½ of the pan should be filled with oil). Heat the oil until very hot and then place the chicken pieces into the pan. 
                First, brown the pieces on both sides, maintaining the hotness of the oil. 
                Next, reduce the flame and cover the pan, cooking for about half an hour. 
                Finally, remove the lid, raise the heat again, and fry the meat until crispy.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 5/5</strong>
                Place the fried pieces onto some paper towel to drain. If you are frying in batches, keep the cooked chicken in a warm oven while preparing the remaining pieces.</li>
