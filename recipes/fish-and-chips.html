    <h2>Introduction and History</h2>
    <p>The national dish of Great Britain, fish and chips is one of the country's favorite takeaway meals, and it's incredibly easy to prepare at home. 
        The traditional recipe calls for fillets of cod or haddock that are first evenly coated in a batter made of just flour, water, and baking soda and then fried in beef dripping or lard, while potatoes, which are cut somewhat thicker than regular French fries, are double fried to make them crispier. 
        For serving, fish and chips are just sprinkled with salt and vinegar and are typically plated with a side of mushy peas. 
        Variations on the recipe include using sparkling water or beer instead of tap water, adding milk or eggs to the batter or frying the fish and potatoes in vegetable oil instead of lard. You can buy fish and chips at more than 11.000 shops colloquially called chippies, that are at present operating in the UK and Ireland. </p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe adapted from www.bbcgoodfood.com is for fish and chips prepared somewhat in a traditional manner, the exception being the potato chips that are baked instead of fried. 
        This recipe also has instructions on how to make mushy peas, a classic accompaniment to fish and chips. One tip — you should prepare the potatoes one to two hours ahead of time so that they can be ready for serving at the same time as the peas and the fish fillets.</p>

    <h3>PREPARATION</h3>    
        <ol>

            <li><strong>Step 1/9</strong>
                To prepare the potatoes, scrub them and cut them first into 1.25 cm (1/2-inch) slices, and then cut each slice into 1.25 cm (1/2-inch) thick chips. 
                Transfer the chips to a large saucepan and cover them with water. 
                Once the water is boiling, lower the heat and leave to simmer for only four minutes, then drain, and transfer onto a clean cloth. 
                Pat dry the chips and leave them to cool.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2/9</strong>
                While the chips are cooling, set the oven to preheat to 220°C/430°F. 
                Once heated, place a large, shallow non-stick tray, to which you've previously added one tbsp of olive oil, into the oven and leave it to warm for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3/9</strong>
                Place the now cooled chips in a bowl and toss them with the remaining oil. 
                Arrange them in a single layer on a hot tray and bake them first for 10 minutes, then turn them over and bake for another 5 minutes. 
                Now, turn the chips a second time and bake them for 5-8 minutes until they crisp up then place them on a paper towel to drain.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 4/9</strong>
                While the chips are still baking, you can prepare the peas. 
                Cook them in boiling water for 4 minutes. Drain them and transfer them to a bowl, then using the back of a fork, lightly crush them. 
                Mix in the oil, lemon juice, and freshly grated pepper, then cover and set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 5/9</strong>
                Put 1 tbsp of flour on a plate and pat dry the fish fillets with paper towels. Coat each fillet in flour and pat off the excess.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 6/9</strong>
                Half-fill a heavy non-stick wok or a pan with oil and heat it to 200°C/400°F (use a thermometer to know when the oil reaches the desired temperature).</li>
            <li><strong>Step 7/9</strong>
                Dip fish fillets into the batter, making sure they are evenly coated, and then immediately place them in hot oil. 
                Fry two fish fillets at a time for 5-6 minutes, turning them halfway through, all the time making sure the oil doesn't fall or go above 200°C/400°F. 
                Use a slotted spoon to take the fillets out of the oil and place them on a paper towel to drain. Repeat the process with the remaining fillets.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 8/9</strong>
                Separately combine 50g (1.75 oz) flour, cornflour, a pinch of salt, and some ground pepper, then in another bowl, whisk an egg white until it bubbles up. 
                Next, pour the water into the flour mix, carefully whisking as you pour, then add the egg white and whisk just until it mixes into the batter, which should not be entirely smooth, and you want to make sure you keep as many bubbles as possible.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 9/9</strong>
                Reheat the peas and divide them between plates, then add to each a portion of fish, chips, and lemon wedges.</li>
