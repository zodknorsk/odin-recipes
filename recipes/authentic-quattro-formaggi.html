    <h1>Authentic Quattro Formaggi</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the traditional quattro formaggi recipe. The amounts of ingredients listed to make the dough are enough for two pizzas 28-30cm (11-12 inches) in diameter.
    In contrast, the amounts for the topping are intended for one pizza, so adjust the amounts accordingly. If using fresh brewer's yeast, first, dissolve it in half the amount of warm water needed to make the dough and dissolve the malt or honey in the other half,
    then add them both to the flour. Also, the dough for the pizza needs to rise for 3-4 hours, so take that into account.</p>
    <h3>Cooking tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dough</strong>: 
            To achieve the perfect consistency, when making the dough, keep some extra flour and water nearby to add if necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese</strong>:
            You can make a topping of just mozzarella and ricotta, or use different kinds of cheese like pecorino and stracchino cheese or gorgonzola. Swiss cheese has incredible melting properties, so it is not uncommon to find recipes calling for Gruyère or other suitable cheeses produced outside of Italy.</li>
    </ul>
