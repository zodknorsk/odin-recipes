# odin-recipes
First The Odin Proyect's project: Basic web with links to different recipes.

The web is made with what TOP has taught so far in the Foundations: Basic HTML. There is no CSS or JS work at all.

In this project I have reviewed all the part of: 
- Creating HTML files
- HTML basics
- GIT Basics

Everything through the terminal to get a proper workflow.
Estimated time to complete the project: 1h15 ~~

Edit 1: Now that I've made some progress in TOP and can write some basic CSS, I've updated the page to give it some personality.
